infec_####_##.csv contains 1000 simulation for the given setting. The first 3-4 digits represent the true population size (500-1000-5000). The second pair of digits represent the basic reproduction number (1.5,2.5,3.5). In general, gamma is fixed at 0.2 and beta is changed to achieve the target R0. If there is "m" at the end, it means that there modified rates, i.e. gamma=0.1 and beta=0.00025.

Sellke_infec_####_##.csv has the same meaning for numbers. The data is simulated using SDS method (KhudaBukhsh et al).  Note only the first 20 were used for evaluations.

true_sol.csv Contains solution data to the determenistic system of equation for given settings

Note that simulated data do not have any headings for rows
